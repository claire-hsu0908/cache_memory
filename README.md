**Introduction:**
A write-through and no-write allocate cache simulator that could run cache miss test on configurable caches (tests included in program) through taking in input parameters (cache size, block size, and set-associativity) while employing a Least Recently Used replacement policy. Output provides type of access, memory address, hit or miss, and value loaded for load instructions.
